# Managing Machine Learning Workflows using Prefect 2.0

## In this repository, you will find three versions of app

> `version_1` - Breaking the Jupyter Notebook to Python Script (Basic Code without workflow management)  
> `version_2` - Code with Prefect Workflow - Defining the workflow and running them
