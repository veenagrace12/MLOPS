# Managing Machine Learning Workflows using Prefect 2.0

## In this repository, you will find three versions of app

> `version_1` - Breaking the Jupyter Notebook to Python Script (Basic Code without workflow management)  
> `version_2` - Code with Prefect Workflow - Defining the workflow and running them  
> `version_3` - Deployment and Scheduling tasks

### Why Prefect?
- Python based open source tool  
- Manage ML Pipelines  
- Schedule and Monitor the flow  
- Gives observability into failures  
- Native dask integration for scaling (Dask is used for parallel computing)
